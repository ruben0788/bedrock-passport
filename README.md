# bedrock-passport

[![Build Status](http://ci.digitalbazaar.com/buildStatus/icon?job=bedrock-passport)](http://ci.digitalbazaar.com/job/bedrock-passport)

A [bedrock][] module that adds website or REST API authentication to
[bedrock][] via [passport][].

## Requirements

- npm v3+

## Quick Examples

```
npm install bedrock-passport
```

```js
const brPassport = require('bedrock-passport');

app.server.post('/resources/:resourceId',
  brPassport.ensureAuthenticated,
  (req, res, next) => {
    // resourceId available with req.params.resourceId
    // user identity available with req.user.identity
    res.sendStatus(204);
  });
```

## Configuration

For documentation on configuration, see [config.js](./lib/config.js).

## Authentication

There are a number of ways a client may authenticate itself with the REST API.
These methods include:

- Website session based on user and password and using cookies.
- [HTTP Signatures][]

### Cookies

This method of authentication is useful for clients that are under your control
and who you trust with your password to the service.

### HTTP Signatures

[HTTP Signatures][]-based authentication which is useful for non-interactive
clients, and clients that you do not want to provide a password for.

## API

### authenticate({strategy, req, res, options = {}}, callback(err, {user}))

Attempt to authenticate a user using the specified strategy. If authentication
is successful, a `bedrock-passport.authenticate` event is emitted with an
object with this format:

```js
{
  strategy,
  options,
  user
}
```

Once all event handlers have run, `callback` is called (or the returned
Promise resolves for Promise users).

### authenticateAll({req, res, options = {}}, callback(err, {user}))

Attempt to authenticate a user using all configured strategies. For every
authentication method, `authenticate` will be called. If more than
one authentication method is configured to run automatically, all of the
associated accounts must match. Any identities detected may be different and
will be given in `user.identities`. The `actor` (all combined capabilities
detected from all authenticated identities) is available on `user.actor`. This
function also returns a Promise so `callback` is not necessary when using
promises.

### createMiddleware({strategy, options})

Creates express middleware that calls `authenticate` using the given strategy.

### optionallyAuthenticated(req, res, next)

Express middleware that processes a request has been optionally authenticated
via `authenticateAll`. Code using this call can check if the request is
authenticated by testing if `req.user` and `req.user.actor` are set.

### ensureAuthenticated(req, res, next)

Express middleware that ensures a request has been authenticated via
`optionallyAuthenticated`. Redirect if not and it looks like a browser GET
request, otherwise set a 400 error.
